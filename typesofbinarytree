1) full binary tree
	def: every node has 2 or 0 nodes
2) complete binary tree 
	def: all the levels are completely filled except possibly last level and last level is filled left to right
3) perfect binary tree
	def : number of nodes in level l = 2^p  l = {0, 1, .....}
4) balaced binary tree 
	def : |height of left subtree - height of right subtree | <= 1 recursively maxheight = Log(N) proof it
5) degenerate or pathological tree 
	def : just chain like linked list
